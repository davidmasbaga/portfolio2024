        <p class="serif mb-4 text-base font-normal text-white "> <span class="font-bold text-accent">- Supply Manager:</span> In Growwer
            I started as a Supply Specialist at Growwer, an online tool for selling advertising for various projects. My initial role involved prospecting new media to register in our database. After a few months, I was promoted to Supply Manager. In this role, I organized teams for prospecting activities. Currently, I continue in this task, among others. A key function I frequently perform is data analysis to extract valuable insights from our users. During 2022 and 2023, I have designed and conducted the annual Link Building study at Growwer.

            <span class="font-bold text-accent">- Scrum Master:</span> Growwer offers a 'Managed Clients' feature, where the client doesn't use the tool directly; instead, our team devises strategies and executes online visibility campaigns for them. Presently, there are four managers handling a diverse client portfolio. The operation involves various phases, from client onboarding, media proposals, campaign execution, to ensuring customer retention. My role in this department is as a Scrum Master. I manage weekly sprints, balance workloads, identify delays and opportunities, and ensure that all proposals are delivered on time.

              >- Junior Q&A Tester with Playwright:</span
            >  I began in the role of QA Tester by conducting manual E2E tests. Eventually, we transitioned to automating these tests using Playwright. My responsibility was to program automated end-to-end tests, with the existing database logic and APIs, to validate the proper functioning of the tool’s features by simulating user actions.

              >- Other development functions:</span
            >   I have developed solutions to automate processes using no-code tools such as Active Campaign. This includes designing the entire workflow and creating automations with scripts in Node, as well as full applications using NextJs. An example is the AIWS tool, a suite of NextJs tools with an Express backend, connected to the OpenAI API, providing automated SEO solutions like keyword clustering, funnel stage identification, briefing generators for copywriters, etc. I have also developed scrapers using Puppeteer and a blog template in Astro to generate web pages automatically by simply feeding in MDX articles with their headers, among many other applications. These projects are detailed in my portfolio.</p>

        <p class=" serif text-base font-normal text-white ">During my master's program, I acquired comprehensive knowledge in various technologies for full-stack web application development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). My capstone project was the creation of a LinkedIn replica, where I worked in a team environment applying agile methodologies. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also improved my teamwork and project management abilities. We successfully developed a functional tool that reflected the LinkedIn platform's key features.<br/><br/>In addition to mastering the MERN stack, I expanded my skill set to include TypeScript, Next.js, WebSockets, and Cypress for both unit and E2E testing. My experience also covers working with Docker for application deployment and managing SQL databases. These skills were integral to my development as a full-stack developer and contributed significantly to my practical understanding of web application development.</p>

        <p class="serif text-base font-normal text-white ">In 2012, together with a partner, we founded Visual Foto, our photographic agency specializing in social and advertising photography. We had the opportunity to work with renowned clients such as Disney, Unilever, Moncho's, Marco de Comunicación, Netflix, Le Meridien Barcelona, and EADA. Running Visual Foto not only honed my skills in photography but also significantly deepened my understanding of graphic design, business management, and leadership. <br/><br/>This comprehensive experience was pivotal in 2015 when I embarked on a second venture, Two Little Draws. This small brand, focusing on graphic design, was born from the insights and expertise I gained through managing and growing Visual Foto. <br/><br/>Both endeavors have been instrumental in developing my skills across various domains, including design, business strategy, and team leadership, allowing me to understand and excel in the multifaceted aspects of running a business.</p>
