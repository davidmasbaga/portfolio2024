      JavaScript Developer | Delio App, Walmeric (Globant)
    </h3>
    <p class="timeline-paragraph">
      I currently work as a JavaScript Developer at <strong>Globant</strong>,
      contributing to the <strong>Delio</strong> project for <strong
        >Walmeric</strong
      >, a web-based lead nurturing application used to manage, visualize, and
      optimize marketing and sales data.
      <br /><br />

      My role focuses on the evolution and maintenance of complex dashboards,
      interactive boards, and data-driven management tables. Among the main
      challenges I have addressed are the implementation of a <strong
        >multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong
      > system on the frontend—significantly improving login security—and the development
      of a <strong>custom drag &amp; drop grid</strong> that allows users to efficiently
      manage and reorder purge orders.
      <br /><br />

      I have also worked on <strong>cross-window communication</strong> to synchronize
      actions and data in real time, improving consistency and user experience across
      different application contexts. These implementations have contributed to more
      robust workflows and smoother user interactions within the platform.
      <br /><br />

      In my day-to-day work, I apply <strong
        >object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong
      > principles and frontend best practices, collaborating closely with multidisciplinary
      teams using <strong>Jira</strong> for agile task management, <strong
        >Bitbucket (Git)</strong
      > for version control, and <strong>Postman</strong> for API testing and integration
      validation.
      <br /><br />

      Supply Manager, Scrum Master & Junior QA Tester | Growwer.com
    </h3>
    <p class="timeline-paragraph">
      <span class="font-bold text-accent">- Supply Manager:</span> In Growwer I started
      as a Supply Specialist at Growwer, an online tool for selling advertising for
      various projects. My initial role involved prospecting new media to register
      in our database. After a few months, I was promoted to Supply Manager. In this
      role, I organized teams for prospecting activities. Currently, I continue in
      this task, among others. A key function I frequently perform is data analysis
      to extract valuable insights from our users. During 2022 and 2023, I have designed
      and conducted the annual Link Building study at Growwer.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="font-bold text-accent">- Scrum Master:</span> Growwer offers a
      'Managed Clients' feature, where the client doesn't use the tool directly; instead,
      our team devises strategies and executes online visibility campaigns for them.
      Presently, there are four managers handling a diverse client portfolio. The
      operation involves various phases, from client onboarding, media proposals,
      campaign execution, to ensuring customer retention. My role in this department
      is as a Scrum Master. I manage weekly sprints, balance workloads, identify delays
      and opportunities, and ensure that all proposals are delivered on time.

      <span class="font-bold text-accent"
        >- Junior Q&A Tester with Playwright:</span
      > I began in the role of QA Tester by conducting manual E2E tests. Eventually,
      we transitioned to automating these tests using Playwright. My responsibility
      was to program automated end-to-end tests, with the existing database logic
      and APIs, to validate the proper functioning of the tool’s features by simulating
      user actions.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="font-bold text-accent">- Other development functions:</span> I
      have developed solutions to automate processes using no-code tools such as Active
      Campaign. This includes designing the entire workflow and creating automations
      with scripts in Node, as well as full applications using NextJs. An example
      is the AIWS tool, a suite of NextJs tools with an Express backend, connected
      to the OpenAI API, providing automated SEO solutions like keyword clustering,
      funnel stage identification, briefing generators for copywriters, etc. I have
      also developed scrapers using Puppeteer and a blog template in Astro to generate
      web pages automatically by simply feeding in MDX articles with their headers,
      among many other applications. These projects are detailed in my portfolio.

      Full Stack Developer Bootcamp | Nuclio Digital School
    </h3>
    <p class="timeline-paragraph">
      During my master's program, I acquired comprehensive knowledge in various
      technologies for full-stack web application development using the MERN
      stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). My capstone project was the
      creation of a LinkedIn replica, where I worked in a team environment
      applying agile methodologies. This experience not only honed my technical
      skills but also improved my teamwork and project management abilities. We
      successfully developed a functional tool that reflected the LinkedIn
      platform's key features.<br /><br />In addition to mastering the MERN
      stack, I expanded my skill set to include TypeScript, Next.js, WebSockets,
      and Cypress for both unit and E2E testing. My experience also covers
      working with Docker for application deployment and managing SQL databases.
      These skills were integral to my development as a full-stack developer and
      contributed significantly to my practical understanding of web application
      development.

      In 2012, together with a partner, we founded Visual Foto, our photographic
      agency specializing in social and advertising photography. We had the
      opportunity to work with renowned clients such as Disney, Unilever,
      Moncho's, Marco de Comunicación, Netflix, Le Meridien Barcelona, and EADA.
      Running Visual Foto not only honed my skills in photography but also
      significantly deepened my understanding of graphic design, business
      management, and leadership. <br /><br />This comprehensive experience was
      pivotal in 2015 when I embarked on a second venture, Two Little Draws.
      This small brand, focusing on graphic design, was born from the insights
      and expertise I gained through managing and growing Visual Foto. <br /><br
      />Both endeavors have been instrumental in developing my skills across
